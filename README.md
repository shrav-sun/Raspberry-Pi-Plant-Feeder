# Raspberry-Pi-Plant-Feeder
This project is to control a raspberry pi with this source code. This will be the code we are using and source code.

# Pump and Moisture Sensor
This is relatively easy to use because all you need to do to run this is to extract plant-moisture-pump.zip and save the folder to /Home/pi. Then, in the terminal, type 'cd plant-moisture-pump' and then 'npm run start'. This will start the program and no further physical actions are required. The pump will automatically pump water if the soil is dry.

# Humidity Sensor
To check the humidity sensor, use 'python3 ~/humidity.py' and 'python3 ~/humidity_logger.py'.
